        <h1>Enigma</h1>
        <h5>Rules and examples</h5>

        <section id="explain">
            Hi! If you‚Äôre seeing this, you‚Äôre likely new to Enigma (or even cryptic quizzes in general). Some basic
            elementary stuff (the exact rules will be on the discord server):
            <ol>
                <li>
                    You do NOT have to be online and participating in the hunt for the entirety of its duration (30+
                    hours). This should be obvious but there was some confusion regarding this last time, so we thought
                    we would put it out there. Most people work at the hunt for a few hours, and then go and do their
                    own thing for a while and then come back to work at it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    About nighttime: the site WILL be online. So you‚Äôre free to attempt the hunt past the midnight toll
                    (this is generally a good time to catch up as at least some teams go inactive). However, assistance
                    from the Team Impulse, if required, may not be as prompt during night hours.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There will be a total of ‚Äòonly‚Äô 16 questions, but don‚Äôt be fooled! An Enigma Cryptic Hunt question
                    can take anywhere between 15 minutes and never to never to solve (but the average team solves the
                    average question in say, 45 minutes). So if you‚Äôre hopelessly mired in a question with no hope
                    visible, don‚Äôt panic! It happens to literally everyone, which is why we give out hints for certain
                    questions at our discretion. Samples of last year‚Äôs questions will be given below.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The questions themselves can be in text, image or external link form. They can reference
                    pop-culture, different languages, riddles, anything.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now, how will you contact us in case of any issues? Discord! We will send you (and your team
                    members), the invite for the Enigma ‚Äò20 Discord server a day before the event (i.e. on 28th May) on
                    the emails that you have entered on the registration form (each team member will need to have
                    discord accounts registered to the same addresses). This will make it easier for us to keep in touch
                    with all teams, and also provide for some light-hearted chatter between the competitors (P.S: We
                    will know if you even TRY to cheat. So don‚Äôt.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    You (and your team members, if applicable) will be sent another email with your login details for
                    the competition at 03:14 pm, 29th May.
                </li>
            </ol>
            Now, we have compiled some of the questions of Enigma ‚Äò19 in case you want to look at the type of questions
            that are asked.

                    ‚ÄúSie haben den Tesseract noch nicht‚Äù. <br>

                    HINT 1: Minimum moo winter sport
                    <br>
                    Explanation: The first two lines refer to the chapter ‚ÄòEuclidean Geometry‚Äô (which has been removed
                    this year). The chapter contained postulates such as ‚ÄúHalves of equals are equal‚Äù and ‚ÄúA part cannot
                    be larger than whole‚Äù, i.e obvious truths, and as such the chapter was the easiest chapter that year
                    (laughing stock). 3 refers to the three euclidean dimensions. ‚ÄòCombined with four‚Äô alludes to the
                    fact that the three dimensions are being combined with a fourth one (time). This combination of
                    Euclidean Space with Time is known as Minkowski Space. The last line is merely the german
                    translation of the line from Avengers: You don't have the Tesseract yet. Tesseract is also the 4-D
                    equivalent of a cube, and the german refers to the fact that Minkowski was german. It also serves as
                    a sort of red-herring by introducing Marvel and Avengers to throw the participant off. The hint:

                <h5 class="explanation">HINT: Apollo
                    <br>
                    Explanation: This is a favourite. The lyrics are the opening lines of Queen‚Äôs Bohemian Rhapsody. The
                    only physics-related item mentioned in the song is ‚ÄòGalileo‚Äô (that old man). Greek God 15 refers to
                    Apollo 15 (infinite blackness => space), one of the manned moon missions. One of the astronauts on
                    it, David Scott performed the famous Hammer-Feather Drop experiment on the moon - both indeed fell
                    together in the near-vacuum conditions on the moon.

                <h5 class="explanation">HINT 1: A bath sponge is somehow related to this. <br>
                    HINT 2: There ain‚Äôt no blank space, really. It‚Äôs all fluctuations‚Ä¶ <br>

                    Explanation: Okay, so this was a tricky one. THe first three lines refer to John Wheeler, who
                    proposed this theory (wheeler=>rolling, john=>watson, Bombs=>he worked on the Manhattan Project).
                    The theory isn‚Äôt a great fan of Swift‚Äôs ‚ÄòBlank Space‚Äô as according to it, there IS no truly blank,
                    or empty, space. According to it, all space is continuously fluctuating due to quantum mechanics and
                    is ‚Äòfoaming‚Äô like beer. It is as yet unproven (hear-say).
                    A bath sponge is an example of foam.
